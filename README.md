# Mars Rover

As a part of LC101 I was tasked with creating a simulation for issuing commands to Curiosity.

The idea was to create a command at mission control, convert that command into a message, send it to the rover, and then have the rover respond to that message.

This task put my unit testing, module making, and exception-handling knowledge to use by writing tests and classes for the Mars rover named Curiosity.

In true TDD form, I first wrote the appropriate units tests for these features, then wrote the code in the given class to pass those tests.
