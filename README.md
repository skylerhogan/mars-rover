# Mars Rover

As a part of LC101 I was tasked with creating a simulation for issuing commands to Curiosity.

The idea was to create a command at mission control, convert that command into a message, send it to the rover, and then have the rover respond to that message.
  
In true TDD form, I first wrote the appropriate units tests for these features, then wrote the code in the given class to pass those tests.

## Things I learned:
  
  1) Implementation of unit testing
  2) The importance and value of test-driven development (TDD)
  3) How to create modules in JavaScript
  4) Exceptions and exception-handling
  5) Classes and constructors
